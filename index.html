				<p>Greece (Greek: Ελλάδα, romanized: Elláda, [eˈlaða]), officially the Hellenic Republic,[a] is a
					country in
					Southeast
					Europe. It is situated on the southern tip of the Balkans, and is located at the crossroads of
					Europe, Asia,
					and
					Africa. Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to
					the north,
					and
					Turkey to the northeast. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the
					west, and
					the Sea of
					Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean
					Basin,
					featuring
					thousands of islands. The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a
					population of
					approximately 10.7 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by
					Thessaloniki.<br>

					Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western
					philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical
					principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised
					into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the
					Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the
					fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world,
					from the eastern Mediterranean to India. The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek
					culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an
					integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally
					and linguistically predominantly Greek. The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first
					century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider
					Orthodox world. After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern
					nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. The country's rich historical legacy is
					reflected in part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.<br>

					Greece is a unitary parliamentary republic, and a developed country, with an advanced high-income
					economy, and a high quality of life, ranking 32nd in the Human Development Index. Its economy is the
					largest in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. A founding member of the United
					Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European
					Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other
					international institutions, including the Council of Europe, NATO, the OECD, the WTO, and the OSCE.
					Greece's unique cultural heritage, large tourism industry, prominent shipping sector and
					geostrategic importance classify it as a middle power.</p>

				<div class="vl"></div>
				<p class="subtitle">Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Greece">Name of
						Greece</a></p>
				<p>The native name of the country in Modern Greek is Ελλάδα (audio speaker iconElláda, pronounced
					[eˈlaða]). The corresponding form in Ancient Greek and conservative formal Modern Greek
					(Katharevousa) is Ἑλλάς (Hellas, classical: [hel.lás], modern: [eˈlas]). This is the source of the
					English alternate name Hellas, which is mostly found in archaic or poetic contexts today. The Greek
					adjectival form ελληνικός (ellinikos, [eliniˈkos]) is sometimes also translated as Hellenic and is
					often rendered in this way in the formal names of Greek institutions, as in the official name of the
					Greek state, the Hellenic Republic (Ελληνική Δημοκρατία, [eliniˈci ðimokraˈti.a]).[12]

					The English names Greece and Greek are derived, via the Latin Graecia and Graecus, from the name of
					the Graeci (Γραικοί, Graikoí; singular Γραικός, Graikós), who were among the first ancient Greek
					tribes to settle Magna Graecia in southern Italy. The term is possibly derived from the
					Proto-Indo-European root *ǵerh₂-, "to grow old".[citation needed]

						The earliest evidence of the presence of human ancestors in the southern Balkans, dated to
						270,000
						BC, is to be found in the Petralona cave, in the Greek province of Macedonia.[13] The Apidima
						Cave
						in Mani, in southern Greece, contains the oldest remains of anatomically modern humans outside
						of
						Africa, dated to 210,000 years ago.[14][15][16] All three stages of the Stone Age (Paleolithic,
						Mesolithic, and Neolithic) are represented in Greece, for example in the Franchthi Cave.[17]
						Neolithic settlements in Greece, dating from the 7th millennium BC,[13] are the oldest in Europe
						by
						several centuries, as Greece lies on the route via which farming spread from the Near East to
						Europe.[18] Following the end of the Greek Neolithic period in 3.200 BC, a slow transition
						period
						between the stone economy to the bronze economy during the end of the 4th Millennium BC
						including
						Eutresis culture and Korakou culture with the first large buildings (House of the Tiles) until
						the
						middle of the 3rd Millennium BC took place in the Greek mainland. Tiryns culture before the
						Middle
						Helladic period that developed the socioeconomic base of the following Minoan civilization and

						Greece is home to the first advanced civilizations in Europe and is considered the birthplace of
						Western civilisation,[20][21][22][23][24][25][26] beginning with the Cycladic civilization on
						the
						islands of the Aegean Sea at around 3200 BC,[27] the Minoan civilization in Crete (2700–1500
						BC),[26][28] and then the Mycenaean civilization on the mainland (1600–1100 BC).[28] These
						civilizations possessed writing, the Minoans using an undeciphered script known as Linear A, and
						the
						Mycenaeans writing the earliest attested form of Greek in Linear B. The Mycenaeans gradually
						absorbed the Minoans, but collapsed violently around 1200 BC, along with other civilizations,
						during
						the regional event known as the Late Bronze Age collapse.[29] This ushered in a period known as
						the
						Greek Dark Ages, from which written records are absent. Though the unearthed Linear B texts are
						too
						fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape and can't support the existence of
						a
						larger state, contemporary Hittite and Egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state
						under
						a "Great King" based in mainland Greece.[30][31]

						The Iliad and the Odyssey, the foundational texts of Western literature, are believed to have
						been
						composed by Homer in the 7th or 8th centuries BC.[33][34] With the end of the Dark Ages, there
						emerged various kingdoms and city-states across the Greek peninsula, which spread to the shores
						of
						the Black Sea, Southern Italy ("Magna Graecia") and Asia Minor. These states and their colonies
						reached great levels of prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of
						classical Greece, expressed in architecture, drama, science, mathematics and philosophy. In 508
						BC,
						Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.[35][36]

						By 500 BC, the Persian Empire controlled the Greek city states in Asia Minor and Macedonia.[37]
						Attempts by some of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule failed, and
						Persia
						invaded the states of mainland Greece in 492 BC, but was forced to withdraw after a defeat at
						the
						Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. In response, the Greek city-states formed the Hellenic League in
						481
						BC, led by Sparta, which was the first historically recorded union of Greek states since the
						mythical union of the Trojan War.[38][39] A second invasion by the Persians followed in 480 BC.
						Following decisive Greek victories in 480 and 479 BC at Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale, the
						Persians
						were forced to withdraw for a second time, marking their eventual withdrawal from all of their
						European territories. Led by Athens and Sparta, the Greek victories in the Greco-Persian Wars
						are
						considered a pivotal moment in world history,[40] as the 50 years of peace that followed are
						known
						as the Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greek development that laid many of
						the
						foundations of Western civilization.

						Lack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states. The
						most
						devastating intra-Greek war was the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), won by Sparta and marking
						the
						demise of the Athenian Empire as the leading power in ancient Greece. Both Athens and Sparta
						were
						later overshadowed by Thebes and eventually Macedon, with the latter uniting most of the
						city-states
						of the Greek hinterland in the League of Corinth (also known as the Hellenic League or Greek
						League)
						under the control of Philip II.[41] Despite this development, the Greek world remained largely
						fragmented and would not be united under a single power until the Roman years.[42] Sparta did
						not
						join the League and actively fought against it, raising an army led by Agis III to secure the
						city-states of Crete for Persia.[43]

						Greece is a unitary parliamentary republic.[151] The current Constitution was drawn up and
						adopted by the Fifth Revisionary Parliament of the Hellenes and entered into force in 1975 after
						the fall of the military junta of 1967–1974. It has been revised three times since, in 1986,
						2001, 2008 and 2019. The Constitution, which consists of 120 articles, provides for a separation
						of powers into executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and grants extensive specific
						guarantees (further reinforced in 2001) of civil liberties and social rights.[152][153] Women's
						suffrage was guaranteed with an amendment to the 1952 Constitution.

						The nominal head of state is the President of the Republic, who is elected by the Parliament for
						a five-year term.[151] According to the Constitution, executive power is exercised by the
						President and the Government.[151] However, the Constitutional amendment of 1986 curtailed the
						President's duties and powers to a significant extent, rendering the position largely
						ceremonial; most political power is thus vested in the Prime Minister, Greece's head of
						government.[154] The position is filled by the current leader of the political party that can
						obtain a vote of confidence by the Parliament. The President of the Republic formally appoints
						the Prime Minister and, on his recommendation, appoints and dismisses the other members of the
						Cabinet.[151]

						Legislative powers are exercised by a 300-member elective unicameral Parliament.[151] Statutes
						passed by the Parliament are promulgated by the President of the Republic.[151] Parliamentary
						elections are held every four years, but the President of the Republic is obliged to dissolve
						the Parliament earlier on the proposal of the Cabinet, in view of dealing with a national issue
						of exceptional importance.[151] The President is also obliged to dissolve the Parliament
						earlier, if the opposition manages to pass a motion of no confidence.[151] The voting age is
						17.[155]

						According to a 2016 report by the OECD, Greeks display a moderate level of civic participation
						compared to most other developed countries; voter turnout was 64 percent during recent
						elections, lower than the OECD average of 69 percent.[156]

						Since the Kallikratis programme reform entered into effect on 1 January 2011, Greece has
						consisted of 13 regions subdivided into a total of 325, from 2019 332 (Kleisthenis I Programme),
						municipalities. The 54 old prefectures and prefecture-level administrations have been largely
						retained as sub-units of the regions. Seven decentralised administrations group one to three
						regions for administrative purposes on a regional basis. There is also one autonomous area,
						Mount Athos (Greek: Agio Oros, "Holy Mountain"), which borders the region of Central Macedonia.
